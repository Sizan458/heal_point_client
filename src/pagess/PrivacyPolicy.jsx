We regard the lawful and correct treatment of personal information as important to our successful operations and to the maintenance of confidence of those with whom we deal. As such this statement will apply equally to all of our offices irrespective of where they are based. 
  <br />
Child Protection Policy
  <br />
yyyrecognises that we have a fundamental duty of care towards all of the children we engage with including a duty to protect them from abuse. We achieve this through compliance with Bangladesh child protection laws and relevant laws in each of the countries we operate in, as well as by adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) 1989. 
  <br />
Environmental Policy

yyyis committed to meeting Bangladesh and international standards for managing our environmental impact. We recognise the impact of our business operations and activities on the environment. We also recognise the threat of climate change to prosperity, social justice and quality of life. We are therefore committed to managing and minimising our environmental impact. 
  <br />
Freedom of information
   <br />
yyyprides itself on seeking new and open ways of engaging with the worldwide community.  In order to build integrity and trust, it is important that we set an example by opening up more of our organisations to the world. 
Equal Opportunities and Diversity
  <br />
yyycreates international opportunities for the people of Bangladesh and other countries and builds trust between them worldwide. Our work involves developing relationships with people from a wide range of backgrounds and cultures. Working effectively with diversity and promoting equality of opportunity is therefore an essential part of our work.
